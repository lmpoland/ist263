    My name is Leah Poland and I am a sophomore studying retail management at Whitman and have a minor in the iSchool. I am interested in learning more about ecommerce and how retail businesses function. I am certified in Microsoft Excel and have made the Dean’s list consistently in my time at Syracuse University. I enjoy keeping hobbies in my free time and love crocheting and sewing clothes and accessories. In high school, I was a coxswain for my crew team, but now I like to spend time hiking and running. I love drinking coffee and enjoy making it at home every morning or trying new cafés.
